Put the data file T_F41SCHEDULE_B43.csv in the same folder with the HW1.ipynb file and run the HW1.ipynb file.
The output contains numbers, tables, and/or graphs, as requested by the homework assignment.
It is best to directly read the written answers embedded in the HW1.ipynb to get more context, but as requested by the assignment, a separate HW1_Markdown.ipynb.html file contains all written answers.
